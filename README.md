# EEG-Data-Driven-Cognitive-State-Analysis
Abstract:
This project delineates a sophisticated approach in the classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to discern between seizure and non-seizure states, leveraging state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network architectures, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. The primary objective is to refine the accuracy and operational efficiency of diagnostic methodologies for epilepsy, thereby augmenting the analytical paradigms of neurological studies. The process encompasses rigorous EEG signal preprocessing, comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of advanced visualization techniques for an in-depth evaluation of the neural network models' performance.

Objectives:
Implement meticulous preprocessing of EEG data to adapt it for neural network analysis. Employ cutting-edge CNN and Bi-LSTM neural network architectures for effective classification of EEG signals into seizure and non-seizure categories. Conduct thorough performance evaluations of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Contribute to the evolution of diagnostic methodologies for epilepsy and related neurological disorders through robust, data-driven analyses.

Data Source:
The study utilizes the comprehensive CHB-MIT EEG Database, which encompasses EEG recordings from 24 patients over 916 hours, featuring 173 clinically validated seizure instances, post-cessation of anti-seizure medication. This database serves as the foundational dataset for our analyses.
